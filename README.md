# VisualizeRNAseq
R scripts used for visualization of RNA-seq data

These scripts were used for analysis of RNA-seq samples treated with a diverse collection of drugs.  To use these scripts, please carefully modify file paths to reflect the GSEA output of your local file structure, changing path names etc. 

The scripts assume a limited gene set across a large number of samples all in the same GSEA output folder.

The first visualization tool looks at Enrichment Scores for a set of gene sets vs. a set of samples:
